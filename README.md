**About Me**

I'm Job N. Nyameino, a medical doctor and digital health practitioner. I'm pursuing a self-taught computer science 'degree' using the path recommended by Oz Nova and Myles Byrne in their [site](https://teachyourselfcs.com). This repository tracks my journey through the first 'course' i.e. programming using the book structure and interpretation of computer programs (SICP) and it documents my attempt of the book's exercises.

**Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**

The book [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) is a venerated text of computer science that has been around since the '80s and has managed to maintain its relevance even as the computing landscape has changed several times over.

Many respected computer scientists recommend this text wholeheartedly and I'm hoping to find out why by going through it.
